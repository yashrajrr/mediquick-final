## How to Push to GitHub

To push this project to your own GitHub repository, follow these steps in your terminal.

1.  **Initialize Git** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add the remote repository**:
    *This command links your local project to your GitHub repository. You only need to do this once.*
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/AryanSingh-07/MediQuick.git
    ```

3.  **Stage all your files**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

4.  **Commit your changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

5.  **Push your code to GitHub**:
    *This command uploads your committed files to GitHub. The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch so you can use `git push` in the future.*
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    *(Note: Your default branch might be `master` instead of `main`)*
